We use mushroom data set from UCI machine learning repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mushroom)
for validation/testing purpose.

Origin:
Mushroom records drawn from The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms (1981). G. H. Lincoff (Pres.),
New York: Alfred A. Knopf

The 'agaricus.txt.test' file is used by the original developer of xgboost java predictor, in libsvm format.
It was used in dmlc xgboost as an example dataset. But dmlc changed the libsvm format to start with
1 index later. This file however still starts with 0 index.

The 'agaricus_new.txt.test' file is the same as 'agaricus.txt.test' but starts with 1 index, simply
downloaded from https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/tree/master/demo/data
